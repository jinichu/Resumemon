# Resumémon

Upload a resume to Resumémon to generate a Pokemon out of the resume. If you upload two resumes, you can have them battle each other! The strength of each generated Pokemon is dependent on the resume's strength, which is determined by custom heuristics. The better your resume, the stronger your Pokemon.
